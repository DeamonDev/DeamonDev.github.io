          Hello! Thank you for looking forward to my little webpage! I am
          graduate theoretical math major. Some time ago I interrupted my PhD
          (algebraic geometry) and decided to become software developer. As many
          folks coming from this field I'm mostly interested in functional
          programming. Currently I'm working at
          <a href="https://scalac.io/">Scalac</a> as (obviously) Scala devloper.
          Besides Scala I do some projects in Haskell. For many years I've been 
          meditating and studied (non formally) Theravada Buddhism. Currently I'm 
          interested in Druidism. My plan is to post my thoughts from time to time 
          with a hope at least one person could gain from it some insight / knowledge.
          My text editor of choice is neovim.
